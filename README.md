# Hello, I am Olivier :wave:

I come from software engineering and focus on Cloud & Data Platforms.  
  
I lead architectural decisions that shape systems over the long term.  
My work helps prevent technical choices that quietly turn into long-term cost, ownership or scalability constraints.  
  
I contribute to internal platforms, infrastructure tooling and data-centric systems.  
Occasionally, I share practical lessons through talks and workshops at technical conferences and industry meetups in Germany.  
  
More on how I think about architecture and decision-making: https://cloudframework.de

## Selected Work

### Infrastructure & Platform Foundations
- **Terraform Modules for Cloud Platforms**  
  Reusable, versioned Terraform modules designed to make infrastructure ownership explicit and predictable.

### Decision-Driven Cloud Infrastructure
- **Colocated Infrastructure & Deployment Template**  
  A reference structure showing how to co-locate infrastructure with services using Terraform, Terragrunt, and YAML — optimized for clarity, ownership, and low cognitive load.
