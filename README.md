# Hello, I am Olivier, Data Software Engineer :wave:

## In a few words

- As the name suggests, I am from Nice, France. I am living in Germany since 2020 :palm_tree:
- I have run several marathons, wrote few fictions and non-fictions books and regularly publish on my technical blog :books:
- I enjoy giving conferences and share findings with my peers :mortar_board:

## I am currently working on

- Building and Monitoring ELT pipelines (Airflow)
- Managing Data Infrastructures on Google Cloud BigQuery (Terraform)
- Building Stream Ingestors (Python, Docker & Kubernetes)
- Contributing to Breuninger open-source projects ([github.com/e-breuninger](github.com/e-breuninger))
- Leading Workshops and Technical Interviews

## My biggest challenges at the moment

- Getting ride of the technical debt
- Coming into terms with the upcoming technologies
- Enforcing the code best practices and standardisation principles

## What I like in the job

- _Creativity_ and _flexibility_: you develop your own projects on your slack-time and integrate them into our productive environment
- _Empowerement_ and _ownership_: you get to lead the topics that matters for you
- _Technical_ and _social_: being deeply involved in the technics while getting in touch with all the different domains
