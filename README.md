# Hello, I am Olivier :wave:

I come from a software engineering background and focus on Cloud & Data Platforms. I lead architectural decisions that shape systems over the long term.  
  
My work helps prevent technical choices that quitely turn into long-term cost, ownership or scalabiloty constraints.  
  
I contribute to internal platforms, infrastructure tooling and data-centric systems. Occasionally, I share practical lessons through talks and workshops at technical conferences and industry meetups in Germany.  

How I think about architecture and decision-making:
