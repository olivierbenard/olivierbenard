# Hello, I am Olivier, Software Engineer :wave_tone1:

I take care of Breuningerâ€™s Google Cloud data platform, build ETL/ELT data pipelines and the cloud infrastructure for them to shape the scalable future of data-driven work at Breuninger. My background is in Software Engineering.

I read at least one technical book a month and share my findings on technical blog [olivierbenard.fr](https://olivierbenard.fr/) I regularly give presentations and workshops at conferences about the Cloud. Each year, you can find me as a speaker at data events and corporate meetups in Germany e.g., [codetalks.de](https://codetalks.de/) and [data2day.de](https://www.data2day.de/index.php).
