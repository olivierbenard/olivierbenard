# Hello, I am Olivier, Software Engineer :wave:

I regularly give presentations and workshops at conferences about the Cloud. Each year, you can find me as a speaker at data events and corporate meetups in Germany e.g., [codetalks.de](https://codetalks.de/) and [data2day.de](https://www.data2day.de/index.php).

You can find more on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivierbenard/) or my technical blog [olivierbenard.fr](https://olivierbenard.fr/).
