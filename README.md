# Hello, I am Olivier, Data Software Engineer :wave:

## I am currently working on

- Building and Monitoring ELT pipelines (Airflow)
- Managing Data Infrastructures on Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Cloud Storage/Functions, Compute Engine, Terraform)
- Building Stream Ingestors fetching data from different APIs and external DB (Python, Docker, Kubernetes & PostgreSQL)
- Developing different custom REST APIs to enhance our softwares capabilities (facebook, snapchat, jira, rocketchat, gitlab)
- Publishing open-source projects on [github.com/e-breuninger](github.com/e-breuninger) (Python Libraries, Chrome Extensions, Gitlab Monitoring)
- Leading Workshops and Technical Interviews

## My biggest challenges at the moment

- Improving existing pipelines' reliability (pushing for more tests, ISO-standardisation, data validation & monitoring)
- Getting ride of the technical debt (moving toward 100% automation, documentation and infrastructure as code coverage)
- Keeping up with the upcoming technologies (learning new skills, going more in-deept vertically and horizontally)
- Enforcing the code best practices and standardisation principles (via multitude hours of workshops and conferences)
- Strengthening the international spirit, actively connecting the teams (via department tours and promoting english usage)

## What I like in the job

- _Creativity_ and _flexibility_: management is in demand for feedbacks, let you space and slack-times.
- _Empowerement_ and _ownership_: you can own any topics you like inside self-directed teams.
- _Technical_ and _social_: being deeply involved in the technics while getting in touch with all the different domains.
- _Respect_ and _open-mindedness_: the future is global, driven by IT, agility and lean-innovations. Not closed and conservative.

## In a few words

- As the name suggests, I am from France, Nice. I definitively moved in Germany in 2020 :palm_tree:
- I have run several marathons, wrote few fictions and non-fictions books and regularly publish on my technical blog :books:
- I enjoy giving conferences and share findings with my peers :mortar_board:
